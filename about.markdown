Dr. Kathryn ("Kate") Newhart graduated from the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado, USA in 2016 (B.S. Environmental Engineering), 2018 (M.S. Civil and Environmental Engineering), and 2020 (Ph.D. Civil and Environmental Engineering). Initially a conventional environmental engineer, Kate operated bench- and pilot-scale systems for industrial (produced water from hydraulic fracturing operations) and municipal (decentralized and centralized) wastewater treatment. Kate became a self-taught data scientist with guidance from her doctoral co-advisor: Dr. Amanda Hering, a statistican now with Baylor University. Kate continued to focus on applied, full-scale problems in engineered environmental systems with guidance from her primary doctoral advisor: Dr. Tzahi Cath, an  environmental engineer at the Colorado School of Mines. Kate worked with many utility partners throughout her doctoral work and continued with one partner, Metro Water Recovery (Denver, Colorado), after graduation as a Technology and Innovation Engineer. Kate continued to teach at Red Rocks Community College in the Water Quality Management Program during her time at Metro, and ultimately returned to academia after joining the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY in 2021. 

Kate's current research is focused on data-driven process monitoring, control, and optimization of wastewater (disinfection), water reuse (membrane and non-membrane based), and resource recovery (phosphrous precipitation) systems.

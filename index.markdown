ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ **100th citation** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

[My 1st first-author paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=IgFxIPYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33&is_milestone=1), a literature review on the state-of-the-industry data-driven process monitoring for municipal wastewater treatment, published just over 2 years ago just recieved it's 100th citation. It's an exciting milestone as a young academic and could not have been acheived without the guidance and support of my advisors and co-authors. Here's to 100 more!

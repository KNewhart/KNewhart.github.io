**Poop Science for National Security**

Energy security is tied to energy resilliance and independence. My good friend and Environmental Program Director at West Point, LTC Andy Pfluger, is leading a team to pilot co-digestion as a tactic for DOD installation energy independence. The team includes faculty members from the departments of Geography and Environmental Engineering, Chemistry and Life Science, and Civil and Mechanical Engineering, as well as scientists with the Army Engineer Research and Development Center Risk and Decision Team. For this work, the DOD Environmental Security Technology Certification Program has awarded him and our  team $925,000. My role will be to assit our post-doc (soon-to-be Dr. Jennie Callahan) in the co-digestion modeling. I promise our team is better at mathematical modeling than the type of 'modeling' for taking photos. ðŸ¤£

**Recipient of the 2023 ASEE Environmental Engineering Division Early Career Award**

It was an honor to receive the Early Career Award from the Environmental Engineering Division of ASEE for my conference paper: [The Green Escape Room: Part 2 - Teaching Students Professional Engineering Ethics by Applying Environmental Engineering Principles and Deciphering Clues and Puzzles](https://peer.asee.org/40424). In this work, an escape room-style activity was used to challenge senior undergraduate students on their environmental engineering ethics in preparation for the Fundamentals of Engineering exam. I could not have won this award without my co-authors and mentors LTC Andy Pfluger and Dr. Mike Butkus (first and second from the right, respectively). Thank you, Dr. David Sanchez (first from the left) for welcoming me into the Environmental Engineering Division; your passion is an inspiration.

**Open-access textbook: now available!**

Over the past two years, I've worked with a great team of water industry professionals on an open-access textbook: *Pathways to Water Sector Decarbonization, Carbon Capture and Utilization.* Led by Dr. Jason Ren of Princeton University and Dr. Krishna Pagilla of University of Nevada-Reno, it provides an in-depth, up-to-date perspective on modern decarbonization strategies for all aspects of the water sector. Today, it's available to the public for free thanks to IWA Publishing! Check out my contribution, [Chapter 16: Data science tools to enable decarbonized water and wastewater treatment systems](https://doi.org/10.2166/9781789061796_0275).

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ **100th citation** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

[My 1st first-author paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=IgFxIPYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33&is_milestone=1), a literature review on the state-of-the-industry data-driven process monitoring for municipal wastewater treatment, published just over 2 years ago just recieved it's 100th citation. It's an exciting milestone as a young academic and could not have been acheived without the guidance and support of my advisors and co-authors. Here's to 100 more!

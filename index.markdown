**Open-access textbook: now available!**

Over the past two years, I've worked with a great team of water industry professionals on an open-access textbook: *Pathways to Water Sector Decarbonization, Carbon Capture and Utilization.* Led by Dr. Jason Ren of Princeton University and Dr. Krishna Pagilla of University of Nevada-Reno, it provides an in-depth, up-to-date perspective on modern decarbonization strategies for all aspects of the water sector. Today, it's available to the public for free thanks to IWA Publishing! Check out my contribution, [Chapter 16: Data science tools to enable decarbonized water and wastewater treatment systems](https://doi.org/10.2166/9781789061796_0275).

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ **100th citation** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

[My 1st first-author paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=IgFxIPYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33&is_milestone=1), a literature review on the state-of-the-industry data-driven process monitoring for municipal wastewater treatment, published just over 2 years ago just recieved it's 100th citation. It's an exciting milestone as a young academic and could not have been acheived without the guidance and support of my advisors and co-authors. Here's to 100 more!
